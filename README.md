## Installation

After installing the Vampirism Datapack into your world you must use this command **/function vampirism:installation** 

## In game
To become a vampire you must get bitten by a bat, this happens randomly so it may take a while.
	
As a vampire you get 
  **Permanent Extra 2 Hearts**
  
  **Slowness and Mining Fatigue I if it is daytime**, and **Speed and Strength I if it is nighttime.**
	
	
On the sidebar you have a blood counter, you must maintain blood to stay alive!

  If your blood level is 50 or lower you will get the hunger effect.

  If your blood level is 10 or lower you will get the wither effect.
	
  Lastly, if your blood level becomes 0 you will die.

To gain blood back you must stand near a mob, sneak, and attack the mob.

If done successfully you will see blood particles, and your blood level will raise by a certain amount based on the mob.

## List of mobs you can take blood from are

- Villager **(15 Blood)**
- Zombie **(5 Blood)**
- Husk **(5 Blood)** 
- Horse **(5 Blood)** 
- Sheep **(2 Blood)** 
- Pig **(2 Blood)** 
- Chicken **(1 Blood)** 

*more mobs being added in the future depending on feedback on this datapack*
